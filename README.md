# **Facial Emotion Recognition *using* Deep Learning:**

**Facial Emotion Recognition (*FER*)** is an application of deep learning that interprets human emotions through facial expressions.
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify faces into different emotional categories.
It analyzes facial features such as eyes, mouth, and eyebrows to predict emotions accurately.
The system can also perform real-time emotion detection using a webcam feed.
It demonstrates the power of deep learning in understanding human affective behavior.
